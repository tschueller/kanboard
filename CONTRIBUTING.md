   php -S localhost:8000 -t .
   ```

4. **Run unit tests** to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   make test-sqlite # or make test-mysql, make test-postgresql
   ```

### Testing

- Test your changes in different browsers
- Test with multiple database types (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Test with different PHP versions if possible

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request, please:

1. **Read the pull request template** (`.github/pull_request_template.md`)
2. **Create a focused branch** from `main` for your changes
3. **Write clear commit messages** using the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
4. **Keep your changes small and focused** - large PRs are harder to review
5. **Test your changes thoroughly** to ensure they work as expected
6. **Ensure your code passes all tests** and does not introduce new issues
7. **Add or update tests** if when appropriate
8. **Review your code for style and quality** before submitting
